# Greetings
*Hello and a warm welcome. Thank you for taking time to visit.*  
  
I'm **Thach**, a software developer. 
  
This blog is a personal record of things I find interesting, created in my free time. My aim is to document some explorations and build a resource for easy reference for my future self.

The posts here are primarily focused on technical and programming topics. I hope youâ€™ll find something interesting or helpful as well.
  
*Thanks again and wishing you a great day ahead.*

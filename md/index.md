## Understand C/C++ Codebases Quickly Using GDB
When joining a large project, one of the biggest challenges is learning the codebase quickly. A practical way is to run the program under a debugger and watch how things actually work. With GDB, we can step through the code, inspect data and trace the program flow. It gives a clear picture of the system and helps build real understanding.

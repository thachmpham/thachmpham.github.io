# Greeting
Hi there, and a warm welcome to my blog!

I'm Pham Minh Thach. Currently, I'm a software engineer at DEK Technologies, an Endava Company, with a focus on computer networking and distributed systems projects. Previously, I had the opportunity to work as a mobile game developer at Gameloft. I'm excited to dive into the world of programming and eager to connect with you all.

In this blog, my aim is to share practical insights into distributed systems and artificial intelligence.

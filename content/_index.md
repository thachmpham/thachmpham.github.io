# Greeting
Hi there, and a warm welcome to my blog!

I'm Pham Minh Thach. Currently, I'm a software engineer at DEK Technologies, an Endava Company. I specialize in projects related to computer networking and distributed systems. Previously, I had the opportunity to work as a mobile game developer at Gameloft.

In this blog, my aim is to share practical insights into computer networking and distributed systems.  
  
Thanks for your visiting and have a nice day!
